    All MITx tools were developed as prototypes, and were not meant to be final products.  Many of the MITx prototypes later had their development continued and finished by other developers, after handing off the project to them.

<p>
    One of the learning tools I made with MITx, this app was meant to be used with the Linguistics course to give users an easier way of learning the international phonetic alphabet.  There are three main parts to the app: the converter, the table, and the quiz.  If you'd like to see the app itself, click the title (or <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.mitx/www/24.900%20IPA/IPAapp.html">here</a>).  Below you'll find the key features of the app.  For a more detailed description, visit the link, and click the 'About' section.

            <p>Users can now click on a symbol in the output to hear it's pronounciation.  When they hover over a symbol, the table section automatically switches to the table containing that symbol, highlights it in the table, and displays popovers outlining how to pronounce the symbol. </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If you click on a symbol in the table, you can hear it's pronounciation</li>
                    <li>Hovering over the labels in any chart will give you a description of what that label means</li>

                        <p>Clicking a symbol plays audio of the symbol being pronounced, and switches the quiz to that symbol, allowing users to test themselves on specific symbols.</p>

                        <p>All the symbols here are not included in the English language, so clicking on a symbol does not change the quiz symbol</p>

                        <p>The way the chart is displayed is standard for IPA tables, but is a bit confusing at first</p>

                        <p>There are 3 main columns: "Front", "Central", and "Back".  Throughout the table you will see dots.  The picture below shows how they align with the columns, as the columns do slant.</p>

                        <img  class = "modalImg" style = "width: 95%" src = "pictures/web/ipa/VowelTableLines.JPG"/> 

                        <p>Next to every dot there will either be 1 or 2 symbols.  The symbol to the right is rounded, meaning you physically round your lips as you are pronouncing the symbol.  The symbol to the left is unrounded, so you can voice it without doing anything fancy.</p>

                        <p>Like the pulmonics table, clicking a symbol changes the quiz.</p>
