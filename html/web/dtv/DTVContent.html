<p>During my internship with DIRECTV, I worked on an independent project coding a proof of concept application for the set top box on the Interactive Television team.  The project was a Formula 1 Racing application that gave F1 fans an easier way to view different kinds of racing information, all while still watching TV.  I built the application from scratch, both on the front-end and back-end side, with help and advice coming from my mentor throughout the duration of the project.</p>
