<p>ClearSlide is a sales-engagement platform, a tool packed with features that sales-reps and sales-leaders use to close deals.</p>

<p>During my internship with ClearSlide, I was treated as full-fledged software developer for the ClearSlide engineering team.  I was always given tasks and projects relevant to the product, and through this, I learned so much about developing web applications, working in a corporate environment, and being a team player.</p>

  <li><b>My main features: </b>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Lead form preview</i>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Description: </b>Leads forms are forms that potential "leads" (customers that are being introduced to your product through ClearSlide) have to fill out on various occasions: when you're giving a pitch to these leads, when you send out an email blast and a lead opens a presentation in the email, and a variety of other occasions.  When choosing the lead form to use in one of these occasions, there was not much way of remember what your lead form did other than the title of the lead form.  For my first project, I was asked to have a preview of the lead form show up at any place in the ClearSlide website that required choosing a lead form.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><i>Homepage pitch recap</i>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Description: </b>A pitch is a presentation that a ClearSlide user has done.  After a pitch has been completed, it is desirable for the presenter to fill out a pitch recap, or a summary of the pitch.  This usually includes information like the company to which the pitch was presented, important names, how many people were involved with the pitch, etc.  Many presenters choose not to fill out their recap right away, and forget to do it later.  To encourage filling out recaps, we designated a small section of the homepage to display incomplete pitch recaps, and thus allow users to quickly and conveniently fill them out.</li>
